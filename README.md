# Portfolio Website Documentation

## Project Overview

### Project Name:
Portfolio Website

### Purpose:
This portfolio website was developed as a midterm project to showcase my skills, experience, and projects as a web developer. The website serves as an online resume, providing visitors with an overview of my professional background, completed projects, and contact information.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5:** Markup language used for structuring the content of the website.
- **SASS:** Preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS, used to style the website.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language used to add interactivity to the website.
- **Git:** Version control system used to manage the project's source code.

## Features

### Responsive Design:
The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Smooth Scrolling:
Implemented smooth scrolling for a better user experience when navigating between sections.

### Hover Effects:
Used SASS to create subtle hover effects on buttons and project thumbnails to enhance interactivity.

### Modular SASS Structure:
The SASS files are organized into separate partials for better maintainability and reusability. Variables and mixins are used to maintain consistency across the site.

## Development Process

1. **Planning:**
   - Identified the key sections to include in the portfolio (Home, About, Projects, Contact).
   - Created wireframes to visualize the layout and structure.

2. **Setup:**
   - Set up the project environment using Git for version control.
   - Installed SASS and set up the file structure.

3. **Development:**
   - Developed the HTML structure for each section.
   - Styled the website using SASS, leveraging variables, mixins, and partials.
   - Added JavaScript for animations.

4. **Testing:**
   - Tested the website across different browsers and devices to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.
   - Debugged any issues related to layout and styling.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deployed the website to a live online server, ensuring it is accessible online.

## Future Enhancements

- **Re-create using React** - it was required to build the website using sass, now it can be re-created using react

## Conclusion

This portfolio website was an opportunity to apply my web development skills and experiment with SASS for styling. The project helped me better understand the importance of maintainable code and modular design.
